        <p class="1">Hi, my name is Sarawut Mahnokhueng and I am currently pursing in web developement at Northwestern Coding Boot Camp. I know my name does have a pretty unique name and is hard to pronouce it correctly; however, it is very typical where I come from. The way to pronouce is "SA-RAA-WUT MA-NO-KHUENG". I have been in Chicago for 4 years and half, but I originally from Thailand. By my culture, people call each other by their nickname. Then, you also call me by my nickname too which I go by Benz a.k.a. Ben. Feel to call me in any name. </p>
        <p class="2">I am self-motivated, eager and adventurous individual who takes great pride in my ability to work in a team. Also, I am open-minded and capable of adapting quickly to change in order to meet common objectives. I love to travelling espcially natural advanture. My eyes are always wide open to the beautifully extraordinary natue of existence. The existence of life and how the breathtakingly fantastic view occurs, which is the natural selection. </p>
        <p class="3">Every new person we meet is a new opportunity to learn. Approach everyone you meet with an open heart and mind and you're bound to make a great impression.</p>
